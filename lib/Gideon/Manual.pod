=head1 WHAT IS GIDEON?

Gideon is a mapping layer between POMO ( Plain Old Moose Objects ) and your data
sources such as databases, Non-SQL storage and more. It provides a common
interface for your persisted objects no matter what the source is so you can
concentrate on your model ( classes and their relationship ) instead of txeh code
for accessing the data.

=head1 WHY GIDEON?

There are other projects that attempt to do a similar job but Gideon is different
in the sense that the interface provided for your classes doesn't depend on the
data source, folliwing the Data Mapper pattern by Martin Fowler. Gideon also
tries very hard to cause as less impact as possible on your class design.

=head1 AN EXAMPLE

  package Customer;
  use Gideon driver => 'DBI';

  has id => ( 
      is          => 'rw',
      isa         => 'Num', 
      traits      => [ 'Gideon::DBI::Column' ],
      primary_key => 1
  );

  has name => ( 
      is          => 'rw',
      isa         => 'Str', 
      traits      => [ 'Gideon::DBI::Column' ],
  );

  __PACKAGE__->meta->store('mydb:customers');
  __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;

As you can see this is a POMO with an extended meta definition and that's all
that Gideon needs.

  my $customer = Customer->find_one;
  $customer->remove;

  my @johns = Customer->find( name => 'john' );
