=head1 NAME

Creating objects with Gideon

=head1 DESCRIPTION

You can easily persist new object in any gideon data store by using the C<save>
method

=head2 C<save([ %opts ])>

To store a new object you just simply need to call the C<save> method on any
newly created instance. And returns the object if the saving was successful
or C<undef> if the saving operation failed.

    my $new_person = People->new( age => 34, name => 'Mike' );
    say 'Success' if $new_person->save;

Gideon has a plugin that would rise an exception in case the operation fails
rather than returning C<undef>. Please refer to L<Gideon::Plugin::StrictMode> for
more details.

    my $new_person = People->new( age => 34, name => 'Mike' );

    try {
      $new_person->save( -strict => 1 );
      say 'Success';
    }
    catch {
      say 'Failed';
    };
   
In the case of objects persisted into RDB's and auto increment values, Gideon
would auto populate the resulting id back into the object

    my $new_person = People->new( age => 34, name => 'Mike' );
    say $new_person->id; # undef

    $new_person->save;
    say $new_person->id; # '1'
