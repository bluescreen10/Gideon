=head1 Updating objects with Gideon

Gideon can update a single object or a group objects depending on how it is
invoked, B<please make sure you read and understand the documentation> as missues
of this method can cause data corruption

=head2 C<update( %changes )> as a Class method

When C<update> is invoked for a Gideon class it updates all records in a data
store with C<%changes>.

    # Update all objects in the data store
    People->update( status => 'active' );

=head2 C<update( %changes )> as an Instance method

When C<update> is invoked for a Gideon class instance it updates that particular
record and not the rest of the records

    # Update one object
    People->find_one( id => 1 )->update( id => 2 );

=head2 Updating object with C<save>

Additionally you can use the C<save> method to update a particular object.

    my $person = People->find_one( id => 1 );
    
    # Update only the name
    $person->update( name => 'John Doe' );
    # Query: UPDATE ... SET name = 'John Doe' WHERE id = 1

    # Update names
    $person->name('John Doe');
    $person->save;
    # Query: UPDATE ... SET id = 1, name = 'John Doe', ... WHERE id = 1

The difference between C<save> and C<update> is that C<update> gives you a fine
grained control on which fields to update. C<save> sends the entire record as a
whole to the data store.
